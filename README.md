# Taco Template
A barebone starter project that I put together to get seed started with AngularJS+Webpack+Bootstrap3+Font Awesome+Sass. I initially wanted to start with something like John Papas' [HotTowel](https://github.com/johnpapa/HotTowel-Angular), but I really wanted to go with [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) since it seemed shiny and it smelled nice, well, that and I liked the way it worked. This starter should be pretty simple to get running and hopefully I commented on some things so you get an idea of why I put it together the way I did. Some of the ideas found in here are from John Papas' [Angular Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide) Let me know if you have any questions!

## Prerequisites
1. Have computer
2. Have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
3. Pull this repository down locally (zip or git, your call)

## Usage
1. Open up a terminal and go to the root of the taco-template directory
1. Type `npm install` or `npm run init` to install dependencies
1. Type `npm start` to launch webpacks dev server in inline hot mode.
    - Inline gets rid of the status bar for the dev server in your browser and hot allows for quick, in-memory hot code switching when you change files (spelled 'Awesome').
1. Poke around
1. You can run `npm run deploy` if you actually like to deploy your app, I've never use it... :(
1. In case you're new, you can always kill webpack's dev server by hitting `ctrl+c`

## Details
I'll probably add these sometime!

## TODO
* Configure a proxy server for proxying to something like [availity-ekko](https://github.com/Availity/availity-ekko) or another local server
* Comment the code and clean up
* Upgrade to Typescript? Maybe?
